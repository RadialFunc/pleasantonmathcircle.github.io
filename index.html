        <div class="white-text"> Founded in 2011, Pleasanton Math Circle (PMC) exposes young and aspiring math students to unique and challenging topics.

      <div class="col s12 m4">
       <div class="faq-title">How does PMC work?</div>

        <div class="white-text">Within PMC, students are divided into an elementary school division for grades 3 to 5 and a middle school division for grades 6 to 8. Students are guided through the week's topic by lecturers and allowed to develop their ideas with their peers by working in groups.</div> <br/>
        
      </div>

      <div class="col s12 m4">
        <div class="faq-title">Where does PMC meet?</div>
